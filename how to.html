    <p>Use W A S and D to move the ship.</p>
    <p>Use SPACE to fire. Firing depletes the blue energy bar. You cannot fire
      without energy.</p>
    <p>Enemy bullets and crashing into enemies depletes health. Crashing into
      walls is instant death. If the red health bar is depleted, you lose.</p>
    <p>Shoot red enemies to destroy them. Blue enemies are indestructible.</p>
    <p>Your hit-box is limited to the center of the ship, but no part of you can
      collide with a wall.</p>
    <p>Proceed all the way to the right to win.</p>
    <p>There are no extra lives or continues.</p>
